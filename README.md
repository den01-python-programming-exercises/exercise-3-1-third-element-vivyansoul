# Exercise 3.1 Third Element

Write a program that asks the user for strings and adds them to a list. The program stops reading when the user enters an empty string. The program then prints the third element of the list.

Remember that programmers start counting from zero! The program is allowed to malfunction if there are fewer than three entries on the list, so you don't need to prepare for such an event at all.
